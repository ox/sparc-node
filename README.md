# sparc-node

Sparc-node wants to check your Phabricator instance for Diffs and provide a
convenient place to check up on them.

## Running

First make sure you have [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) installed. The
easiest way to do this is through npm:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g electron-prebuilt
```

Then download the code, run `npm install` and run with `npm start`. The process
should be visible as an app in the menubar.
